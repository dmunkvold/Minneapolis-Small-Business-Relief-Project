# Minneapolis-Small-Business-Relief-Project

The Minneapolis Small Business Relief Project is an effort to organize information about local restaurants and small businesses in response to the mandated closures of many modes of business in the city. 

This project is a Rails based web application that will allow businesses in Minneapolis to solicit any services that they still offer as well as advertise for relief funding such that they may make it through the closures caused by Covid-19.

We are first focusing on restaurants and other food service businesse but plan to open it up to all types of businesses.
